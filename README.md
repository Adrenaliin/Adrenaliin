- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Miroslav Krastanov @Adrenaliin

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Programming. I've studied the following languages: 
--- C (in university - only 1 semester and we didn't get in too deep, but I learned a few new things) 
--- C++ (during 6th & 7th grade as an extracurricular subject that I was selected and asked if I want to join, because I was good at math)
--- Java OOP (in university - We had a project at the end. We had to create an app. I developed a chess game. It was nice and I learned a lot.) 
--- CSS (on my own, before & during high school - This helped me build my own website and maintain it for 3 years during High School.)
--- HTML (on my own, before & during high school - Also for my website.)
--- PHP(on my own, before & during high school - I developed interest in learning PHP as well, as it was "hot" back then and I liked it when I started.)

- âœ¨ MY HIGH SCHOOL PET PROJECT - MY VERY OWN WEBSITE :)
In high school I had my own website, where I was creating different modules & dashboards, such as a registration module, forums, user interface and whatever felt fun. The website was my pet project. It wasn't related to my studies. It was just something I was driven to do as it was super interesting to me. I believe it lasted about 3 years and I was doing some updates almost every week. Sometimes I was working on a specific element for days and even in high school I was always looking for people's ideas and I was trying to implement them and learn how to do what I imagined. :)

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript.
