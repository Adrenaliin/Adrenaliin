ðŸ‘€ I am interested in programming, and I am currently learning JavaScript. <br>
ðŸ’» For the past few years I have been working as a technical support agent and that has further solidified my desire to master programming as I was often creating clever ways to use code to improve my work efficiency and provide better quality of service, which magnified my passion to code even more. <br>
